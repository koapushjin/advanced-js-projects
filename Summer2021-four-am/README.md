## Hide and Seek

This is an interactive installation from the "Four AM" multimedia installation art exhibition, composed of acrylic, plastic, holographic screens, a projector, and a webcam. Four AM is assumed to be the ‘witching hour" when supernatural phenomena occur most frequently. The acrylic tubes divide the internal space from the outside, in which there is an existence across infinite disordered time and space. Multilayer projection makes this existing vision stereoscopic. We imagined a rule: when such existence feels that human beings have noticed it, it will hide; on the contrary, it shows its complete form of existence and keeps observing humans. The computer runs the Posenet program and captures users’ eyes through a webcam to decide the size of the projection content.
